t Logic-Gate-Sim
Build, simulate, and abstract your logic gate circuits by including designs within other designs!

This is a simple program where you can drag and drop components onto a grid.

These components can be then simulated.

Components include: AND gate, OR gate, NOT gate, XOR gate

More complex components like latches, flip flops, (de)multiplexors, and RAM modules can be all built with the components mentioned above.

Simply build a complex component from simpler ones, and then save the design. 

The newly saved design/complex component can now be used in other designs!

This allows for layers of abstraction within your designs.

All circuits are build from the ground up, making it easier to learn about complex circuits by looking at the simpler circuits that make it up.

It is even possible (well, in the future) to create a simple 8 bit computer using the abstraction process explained above!
